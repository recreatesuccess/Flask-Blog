# Flask-Blog

Flask blog is a robust web application for blogging. It was made using the Flask framework, HTML, CSS, and lots of python code.

This project took 20 hours to complete, and involved the use of several advanced features. Authentication, Log In/Log Out functionality, Change of Username/Display Picture, Email/Password reset, Use of Databases, Routing, and many more. 

Users are able to Create, Read, Update and delete blog posts. 

While not the next big social media network, it allowed me to improve my skills as a programmer. 

This dynamic web application has a clean design, with a focus on an enhanced user experience.
